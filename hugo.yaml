    items:
      - title: Sustainapod, Events Team
        content: |-
          I've always believed that the best conversations happen when people feel genuinely heard. That's why I joined SustainaPod's Events Team to create spaces where students can connect with sustainability professionals in a way that feels real, not rehearsed.
          - My role is part speaker wrangler, part logistics ninja, and part audience whisperer, making sure every session is interactive, relevant, and actually useful for the students tuning in. It's part logistics, part creative problem-solving, and entirely about creating spaces where young people feel empowered to pursue careers in sustainability.
          - SustainaPod reaches 10,000+ listeners, and I love knowing our events might be the push someone needs to take their next step in this field.

      - title: U&I Trust, Leader
        content: |-
          From 2020 to 2024, I volunteered with U&I Trust and honestly, it was some of the best work I've ever done. I started as a mathematics teacher, teaching in the local language to make sure every student could actually follow along. But after a year, I wanted to do more.
          - I became a Leader, training and mentoring 40+ volunteers across 3 centers, helping them become better teachers and connect meaningfully with students. Together, we ran mentorship and life skills programs for over 100 underprivileged youth aged 14-18.
          - The goal was never just academics, it was about showing young people that someone believed in them. That they had potential. That they mattered. It was challenging, rewarding, and taught me as much as I hope I taught those young minds.
